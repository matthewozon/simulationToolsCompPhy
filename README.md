======================


This project aims to provide numerical tools for simulations of any kind

  1. graph
  2. differential equation solver
  3. lattice Boltzmann
  4. model Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics
  5. FDTD
  6. examples (e.g. light propagation, heat diffusion...)
  7. interaction between objects and system evolution
