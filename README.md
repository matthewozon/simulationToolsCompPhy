simulationToolsCompPhy
======================


This project aims to provide numerical tools for simulations of any kind

  1 graph
  2 differential equation solver
  3 lattice Boltzmann
  4 model Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics
  5 FDTD
  6 examples (light propagation, fluid mechanics, heat diffusion, matter, diffraction)
  7 interaction between objects and system evolution
  
Everything must be created! Feel free to help :-)
